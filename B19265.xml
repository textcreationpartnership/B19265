            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

If the general distraction and confusion which is spread over the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, doth not awaken all men to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and longing, that those Wounds which have so many years together been kept bleeding, may be bound up, all We can say will be to no purpose: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after this long silence, We have thought it our duty to Declare how much We desire to contribute thereunto; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:197788:5"/>that as We can never give over the hope in good time to obtain the Possession of that Right which God and Nature hath made Our Due, so we do make it Our daily suit to the Divine Providence, that he will in compassion to Us and Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, after so long misery and sufferings, remit, and put Us into a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Possession of that Our Right, with as little blood and damage to Our People as is possible: Nor do we desire more to enjoy what is Ours, then that all Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may enjoy what by Law is theirs, by a full and entire Administration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice throughout the Land, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Our Mercy where it is wanted and deserved.</p>
            <p>And to the end that the fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment may not engage any conscious to themselves of what is past, to a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in guilt for the future, by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the quiet and happiness of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:197788:5"/>Countrey, in the Restoration both of King, Peers, and People, to their just, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Fundamental Rights, We do by these presents Declare, That We do grant a Free and General Pardon, which VVe are ready upon demand, to pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Our Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to all Our Subjects of what degree or quality soever, who within Forty days after the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof, shall lay hold upon this Our Grace and Favour, and shall by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Act declare their doing so, and that they return to the Loyalty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of good subjects; Excepting only such persons as shall hereafter be except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Parliament; those onely excepted, let all Our subjects, how faulty soever, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Word of a King, solemnly given by this present Declaration, That no Crime whatsoever committed against Us or Our Royal Father before the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this, shall ever rise in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:197788:6"/>or be brought in question against any of them, to the least endamagement of them, either in their Lives, Liberties, or Estates, or (as far forth as lies in Our power) so much as to the prejudice of their reputations, by any reproach or term of distinction from the rest of Our best Subjects: VVe desiring and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, that henceforth all notes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, separation, and difference of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be utterly abolished among all Our subjects, whom We invite and conjure to a perfect union among themselves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Our Protection, for the re-settlement of Our just Rights and theirs, in a Free Parliament, by which, upon the VVord of a King, We will be advised.</p>
            <p>And because the passion and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness of the times have produced se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral opinions in Religion, by which men are engaged in Parties and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities against each other, which when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:197788:6"/>they shall hereafter unite in a freedom of conversation, will be composed, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood; VVe do declare a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to tender Consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted, or called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion for differences of Opinion in matter of Religion, which do not disturb the peace of the Kingdom, and that We shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as upon mature deliberation shall be offered to Us, for the full grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Indulgence.</p>
            <p>And because in the continued distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of so many years, and so many and great revolutions, many Grants and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases of Estates have been made to, and by many Officers, Souldiers and others, who are now possessed of the same, and who may be liable to Actions at Law, upon several Titles; We are likewise wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that all such differences, and all things relating to such Grants, Sales, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases

            <p>TRusty and Wel-beloved, We Greet you well. In these great and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable afflictions and calamities under which the poor Nation hath been so long exercised, and by which it is so near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, We cannot think of a more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and proper remedy, then to resort to those for Counsel and Advice, who have seen and observed the first beginning of our miseries, the progress from bad to worse, and the mistakes and mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings which have produced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to inconveniences which were not intended; and after so many revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the observation of what hath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:197788:8"/>attended them, are now trusted by Our good Subjects to repair the Breaches which are made, and to provide proper remedies for those evils, and for the last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, happiness and security of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We do assure you upon Our Royal word, that none of Our Predecessors have had a greater esteem of Parliaments, then VVe have, in Our judgement, as well as from Our obligation; We do believe them to be so vital a part of the constitution of the Kingdom, and so necessary for the Government of it, that VVe well know, neither Prince nor People can be in any tolerable degree happy without them; and therefore you may be confident, that VVe shall always look upon their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels as the best We can receive, and shal be as tender of their Priviledges, and as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve and protect them, as of that which is most near to Our self, and most
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:197788:8"/>necessary for Our own preservation.</p>
            <p>And as this is Our opinion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that their Authority is most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, so VVe are most confident that you believe and finde, that the preservation of the Kings Authority is as necessary for the preservation of Parliaments; and that it is not the Name, but the Right constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, which can prepare and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply proper remedies for those evils which are grievous to the people, and which can thereby establish their peace and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. And therefore VVe have not the least doubt, but that you will be as tender in, and as jealous of any thing that may infringe Our Honor, or impair Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as of your own Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which is best preserved by preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the other.</p>
            <p>How far VVe have trusted you in this great Affair, and how much it is in your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:197788:9"/>power to restore the Nation to all that it hath lost, and to redeem it from any infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my it hath undergone, and to make King and People as happy as they ought to be; you will finde by Our inclosed Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Copy of which We have likewise sent to the House of Peers; and you will easily believe that We would not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and of Our self have reposed so great a trust in you, but upon an entire confidence that you will not abuse it, and that you will proceed in such a manner, and with such due consideration of Us who have trusted you, that We shall not be ashamed of declining other assistance (which we have assurance of) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to you for more natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedies for the evils we would be freed from, nor sorry that we have bound up Our own interest so intirely with that of Our Subjects, as that We refer it to the same persons to take care of Us, who are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:197788:9"/>trusted to provide for them. We look upon you as wise and dispassionate men, and good Patriots, who will raise up those Banks and Fences which have been cast down, and who will most reasonably hope, that the same prosperity will again spring from those roots from which it hath heretofore and always grown; nor can We apprehend that you will propose any thing to Us, or expect any thing from Us, but that We are as ready to give, as you to receive.</p>
            <p>If you desire the advancement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Protestant Religion, we have by our constant profession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, given sufficient testimony to the world, that neither the unkindness of those of the same Faith towards Us, nor the civilities and obligations from those of a contrary profession, (of both which we have had abundant evidence) could in the least degree startle Us, or make Us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:197788:10"/>swerve from it; and nothing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to manifest Our zeal and affection for it, to which VVe will not readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And VVe hope in due time Our self to propose somewhat to you for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of it, that will satisfie the world, that We have always made it both Our care and Our study, and have enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served what is most like to bring disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to it.</p>
            <p>If you desire security for those, who in these calamitous times, either wilfully or weakly have transgressed those bounds which were prescribed, and have invaded each others Rights, VVe have left to you to provide for their security and Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in such a way as you shall think just and reasonable; and by a just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of what men have done and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as near as is possible, to take care that all men be satisfied, which is the surest way to suppress and extirpate all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:197788:10"/>such uncharitableness and animosity as might hereafter shake and threaten that peace, which for the present might seem established. If there be a crying sin, for which the Nation may be involved in the Infamy that attends it, We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but that you will be as sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to redeem and vindicate the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from that guilt and infamy, as We can be.</p>
            <p>If you desire that Reverence and Obedience may be paid to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of the Land, and that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice may be equally and impartially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to all men, it is that which We desire to be sworn to Our self, and that all persons in Power and Authority should be so too.</p>
            <p>In a word, There is nothing that you can propose, that may make the Kingdom happy, which We will not contend with you to compass; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:197788:11"/>this confidence and assurance, We have thought fit to send you this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that you may, as much as is possible, at this distance, see Our heart, which when GOD shall bring Us nearer together (as We hope he will do short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) will appear to you very agreeable to what We have professed; and We hope that We have made that right Christian use of Our Affliction, and that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and Experience We have had in other Countries, hath been such, as that We, and We hope all Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, shall be the better for what We have seen and suffered.</p>
            <p>We shall add no more, but Our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Almighty GOD, that He will so bless your Counsels, and direct your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that his Glory and Worship may be provided for, and the Peace, Honour and Happiness of the Nation may be established upon those Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:197788:11"/>which can best support it. And so We bid you farewell.</p>

            <p>TRusty and VVelbeloved, We greet you well: It cannot be believed but that VVe have been, are, and ever must be, as sollicitous as VVe can, by all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to improve the Affections of Our good Subjects at home, and to procure the assistance of Our Friends and Allies abroad, for the recovery of that Right, which by the Laws of God and Man is unquestionable, and of which VVe have been so long dispossessed by such force, and with those circumstances, as VVe do
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:197788:12"/>not desire to aggravate by any sharp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, but rather wish, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of what is passed, may be buried to the world. That VVe have more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prepare, and to improve the affections of Our Subjects at home, for Our Restauration, then to procure as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from abroad to invade either of Our Kingdoms, is as manifest to the world: And VVe cannot give a better evidence that VVe are still of the same minde, then in this conjuncture, when common Reason must satisfie all men, that VVe cannot be without assistance from abroad, VVe chuse rather to send to you, who have it in your own power to prevent that ruine and desolation which a VVar would bring upon the Nation, and to make the whole Kingdom owe the Peace, Happiness, Security, and Glory it shall enjoy, to your Vertue; and to acknowledge that your Armies have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:197788:13"/>complied with their Obligations for which they were first raised, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Protestant Religion, the Honour and Dignity of the King, the Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Fundamental Laws of the Land; and that you have vindicated that Trust, which others most perfidiously abused and betrayed. How much We desire and resolve to contribute to those good ends, will appear to you by Our enclosed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which We desire you to cause to be published for the Information and satisfaction of all good Subjects, who do not desire a further effusion of precious Christian blood, but to have their peace and security sounded upon that which can only support it; an Unity of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongst our selves, an equal Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Justice to men, restoring Parliaments to a full capacity of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for all that is amiss, and the Laws
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:197788:13"/>of the Land to their due veneration.</p>
            <p>You have been your selves witnesses of so many revolutions, and have had so much experience, how far any Power and Authority that is only assumed by passion and appetite, and not supported by Justice, is from providing for the happiness and peace of the people, or from receiving any obedience from them, without which no Government can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them; that you may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably believe, that God hath not been well pleased with the attempts that have been made, since he hath usually increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the confusion, by giving all the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess that hath been desired, and brought that to pass without Effect, which the Designers have proposed as the best means to settle and compose the Nation; and therefore we cannot but hope and believe, that you will concur with Us in the remedy We have applyed, which to humane understanding is only proper for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:197788:14"/>the ills we all groan under; and that you will make your selves the blessed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to bring this blessing of Peace and reconciliation upon King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it being the usual method in which Divine Providence delighteth it self, to use and sanctifie those very means which ill men design for the satisfaction of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and particular Ends and Ambition, and other wicked purposes, to wholsome and publick ends, and to establish that good which is most contrary to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signers; which is the greatest manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's peculiar kindness to a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that can be given in this world. How far We resolve to preserve your Interests, and reward your Services, We refer to Our Declaration; and We hope God will inspire you to perform your Duty to Us, and to your Native Countrey, whose happine's cannot be separated from each other.</p>

            <p>TRusty and Wel-beloved, We Greet you well. In these great revolutions which of late have happened in that Our Kingdom, to the wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the world, there is none that We have looked upon with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, then the so frequent and publick ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations of their affections to Us in the City of <hi>London,</hi> which hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly raised Our Spirits, and which,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:197788:15"/>no doubt hath proceeded from the Spirit of God, and His extraordinary mercy to the Nation, which hath been encouraged by you, and your good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to assert that Government, under which it hath so many hundred years enjoyed as great felicity as any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Europe,</hi> and to discountenance the imaginations of those, who would subject Our Subjects to a Government they have not yet devised; and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the pride and ambition of a few ill men, would introduce the most Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and Tyrannical Power that was ever yet heard of. How long we have all suffered under those and the like devices, all the world takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, to the no small reproach of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, which We hope is now providing for its own security and redemption, and will be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bewitched by those inventions:

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:197788:16"/>other Foundation then the Affection and Hearts of Our Subjects, and their own consents: We have not the least doubt of your just sense of those Our condescentions, or of your zeal to advance and promote the same good end, by disposing all men to meet Us with the same affection and tenderness, in restoring the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws to that reverence that is due to them, and upon the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof all our happiness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: And you will have no reason to doubt of enjoying your full share in that happiness, and of the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it by Our particular affection to you.

            <p>TRusty and Well-beloved, We Greet you well: You will easily believe that your Letter of the Fifth of this Moneth, by Sir <hi>Thomas Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> was very welcome to Us; And that as We must always acknowledge the infinite mercy of God Almighty, in disposing the hearts of the Army in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:197788:18"/>such an entire obedience to you, for the promoting and carrying on Our Service, and the Peace of the Kingdom, so We can never be without a just esteem of such a great and well disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined Army, upon which the eyes of the world are so much fixed. We must desire you to return Our very hearty thanks to the Officers and Soldiers for their affection and obedience to Us; and to assure them from Us, that We shall always have an entire confidence in them, and ever acknowledge them to be the great Instruments of restoring Us to the Nation, and the Nation to Us, and Peace, and Happiness, and Security to Us all: And therefore they may not onely with all imaginable confidence as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselves, that we will punctually perform whatever we have promised to them in Our Declaration or Letter, but that We will take them into Our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:197788:19"/>care and Protection. And if the licence and distemper of the Time shall so far transport any men, as to presume upon memory of former animosities, and of what is past, to use any reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es towards them, We will look upon such persons as disturbers of the Peace and Security of the Kingdom, and shall cause them to be prosecuted according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And towards this Settlement and Composure, and for the prevention of many inconveniences which may fall out, We think nothing so necessary as Our presence with you, by which (in a very short time) every member of the Army, who shall faithfully adhere to you in advancement of the Publick Peace, would, with the blessing of God, finde himself secured and provided for to his satisfaction: And longing for that blessed time, We bid you heartily farewell.</p>

            <p>VVE have had too ample a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of your Affection and Duty towards Us, the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whereof is notorious to the world, to make the least doubt of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and improvement thereof, or in the least degree to dislike what you have done, or to complain of what you have left undone. We know well the weight of those Affairs which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:197788:20"/>depend upon your Counsels, and the time that must unavoidably be spent in Debates, where there must naturally be difference of Opinion and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, amongst those whose desires of the Publick peace and safety are the same; And neither We nor you must be overmuch troubled, if We finde Our good intentions, and the unwearied pains We take to reduce those good intentions into real acts, for the quiet and security of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mis-represented, and mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, by those who are, in truth, afflicted to see the publick distractions, by Gods blessing, so near an end; and by others, upon whose weakness, fears and jealousies, the activity and cunning of those ill men, have too great an influence.</p>
            <p>How wonderful and miraculous soever the great harmony of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:197788:21"/>between Us and Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is, and that it is so visible and manifest to the world, that there scarce appears the view of any cloud to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vershadow or disturb it; yet We must not think that God Almighty hath wrought the Miracle to that degree, that a Nation so miserably divided for so many years, is so soon and entirely united in their affections and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, as were to be wish'd; but that the evil Consciences of many men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so awake for mischief, that they are not willing to take rest themselves, or to suffer others to take it: And We have all had too sad experience of the unhappy effects of fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, how groundless and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable soever, not to think it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary to apply all timely and proper remedies to those distempers, and to prevent the inconveniences
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:197788:21"/>and mischiefs, which too naturally flow from thence: We well foresaw, that the great violation which the Laws of the Land had for so many years sustained, had filled the hearts of the people with a terrible appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of insecurity to themselves, if all they had said and done, should be liable to be examined and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by those Laws which had been so violated; and that nothing could establish the security of King and People, but a full provision, that the returning to the Reverence and Obedience of the Law, (which is good for Us all) should not turn to the ruine of any, who are willing and fit to receive that Protection hereafter from the Law, and to pay that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it that is just and necessary; and therefore We made that free of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of a General Pardon, in such a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:197788:22"/>manner as is expressed in Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and how ready and desirous We are to make good the same, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by Our Proclamation, which We have issued out upon, and according to your desire.</p>
            <p>However, it is evident, that all We have, or do offer, doth not enough compose the mindes of Our People, nor in their opinions can their security be provided for, till the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity and Oblivion be Passed; And We finde great industry is used by those, (who do not wish that Peace to the Kingdom they ought to do) to perswade Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that We have no minde to make good Our promises, which, in truth, We desire to perform for Our own sake as well as theirs: And We do therefore very earnestly recommend it to you, that all possible expedition be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:197788:22"/>used in the Passing that most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Act, whereby Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects generally will be satisfied, that their Security is in their own hand, and depends upon their future acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that they are free for all that is past; and so all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ill men will be disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which would perswade them not to do well now, because they have heretofore done amiss. And We are the more engaged to this Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, because upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of your eminent Zeal and Affection for Our Service, and hearty Concurrence with Us in all We have desired from you, men are apt to perswade others (though they do not believe it themselves) that the Passing of this Act is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deferred, because We do not enough press the dispatch of it,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:197788:23"/>which We do desire from Our heart, and are confident you will the sooner do, upon this Our earnest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.</p>

               <hi>And to the end that the Fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment may not engage any, Conscious to themselves of what is passed, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in Guilt for the future, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Quiet and Happiness of their Countrey, in the Restauration both of King, Peers and People, to their Just, Antient, and Fundamental Rights: We do by these Presents Declare, That We do grant a Free and General Pardon, which We are ready, upon demand, to pass under Our Great Seal of</hi> England, <hi>to all Our Subjects, of what degree or quality soever, who within Forty days after the Publishing hereof, shall lay hold upon this Our Grace and Favour, and shall by any

Those onely excepted, let all Our loving Subjects, how faulty soever, rely upon the Word of a King, solemnly given by this present Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That no Crime whatsoever commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against Ʋs or Our Royal Father, before the Publication of this, shall ever rise in Judgement, or be brought in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion against any of them, to the least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damagement of them, either in their Lives, Liberties, or Estates, or (as far forth as lies in Our Power) so much as to the Prejudice of their Reputations, by any Reproach, or Term of Distinction from the rest of Our best Subjects: We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring and Ordaining, That hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all Notes of Discord, Separation and Difference of Parties be utterly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:197788:25"/>abolished among all Our Subjects, whom We invite and conjure to a perfect Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among themselves under Our Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the Re-settlement of Our Just Rights, and theirs, in a Free Parliament; By which, upon the Word of a King, We will be advised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lords, if you do not joyn with me in extinguishing this Fear, which keeps the hearts of men awake, and apprehensive of Safety and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; You keep Me from performing My Promise, which if I had not made, I am perswaded neither I nor you had been now here: I pray let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive those who brought, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to come together. I knew well there were some men who could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgive themselves, or be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Us; And I thank you for your Justice towards those, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:197788:26"/>Murtherers of My Father: And I will deal truly with you, I never thought of excepting any other. I pray think well upon what I have offered, and the benefit you and I have received from that offer, and encourage and oblige all other persons, by not excluding them from the benefit of this Act. This Mercy and Indulgence is the best way to bring them to a true repentance, and to make them more severe to themselves, when they finde. We are not so to them. It will make them good Subjects to Me, and good Friends and Neighbours to you; and We have then all Our end, and you shall finde this the securest expedient to prevent future mischief: Therefore I do earnestly desire and conjure you, to depart from all particular Animosities and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or memory of past Provocations, and that you will Pass this Act without other exceptions, then of those who were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:197788:26"/>immediately guilty of that Murther of my Father. My Lords, I have told you my opinion, and I hope you will be of the same. If any persons appear of such dangerous and obstinate Principles, that the Peace of the Kingdom cannot be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved whilest they have liberty in it, some other course may be taken, that they shall not be able to do hurt; and I assure you, there is nothing can enable them to do so much harm, as the deferring the Passing this Act.</p>
            <p>I hope I need say nothing of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that they alone shall not be without the benefit of my Mercy: they have shewed much affection to me abroad, and you will have a care of my Honour, and of what I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them. I do again conjure you, that you will use all expedition in the dispatch of this Bill.</p>

            <head>HIS MAIESTIES GRACIOUS SPEECH TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, On the 29<seg rend="sup">th</seg> day of <hi>August</hi> 1660. at the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the ACT of <hi>Free Pardon, Indempnity and Oblivion,</hi> And several other Acts.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been here some times before with you, but never with more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness than I am at this time: And there be few men in the Kingdom, who have longed more impatiently to have these Bills Passed, than I have done to Pass them; and I hope they will be the Foundation of much Security and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to us all.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:197788:27"/>
            <p>I do very willingly pardon all that is pardoned by this Act of Indempnity, to that time which is mentioned in the Bill; nay, I will tell you, that from that time to this day, I will not use great severity, except in such cases where the malice is notorious, and the Publick Peace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly concerned. But for the time to come, the same discretion and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which disposed me to the clemency I have expressed, which is most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Nature, will oblige me to all rigor and severity, how contrary soever it be to my Nature, towards those who shall not now aquiesce, but continue to manifest their Sedition and dislike of the Government, either in action or words. And I must conjure you all (my Lords and Gentlemen) to concur with me in this just and necessary Severity; and that you will in your several Stations be so jealous of the Publick Peace, and of my
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:197788:28"/>particular Honor, that you will cause ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Justice to be done upon those who are guilty of seditious Speeches or Writings, as well as those who break out into Seditious Actions: And that you will believe those who delight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching and traducing my Person, not to be well affected to you and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace. Never King valued himself more upon the affections of his People then I do; nor do I know a better way to make my self sure of your affections, then by being just and kinde to you all: And whilst I am so, I pray let the world see that I am possessed of your affections.</p>
            <p>For your Pole-Bill, I do thank you as much as if the mony were to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my own Coffers; and wish with all my heart, that it may amount to as great a sum as you reckon upon. If the work be well and orderly done, to which it is designed, I am sure I shall be the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:197788:28"/>by it in the end; and upon my word, if I had wherewithal, I would my self help you, so much I desire the business done. I pray' very earnestly, as fast as money comes in, discharge that great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the Navy, and disband the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as fast as you can; and till you can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the rest, make a provision for their support.</p>
            <p>I do conjure you, as you love me, let me not hear the noise of Free-quarter, which will be imputed to my want of Care and Government, how innocent soever I am; and therefore be sure you prevent it.</p>
            <p>I am so confident of your affections, that I will not move you in any thing that immediately relates to my self; and yet I must tell you, I am not richer, that is, I have not so much money in my Purse as when I came to you; the truth is, I have lived principally ever since upon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:197788:29"/>what I brought with me, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed your money; for you sent it to me, and I thank you for it. The weekly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Navy, eats up all you have given me by the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage. Nor have I been able to give my Brothers one shilling since I came into <hi>England,</hi> nor to keep any Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in my house but what I eat my self. And that which troubles me most, is, to see many of you come to me to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and to think that you must go some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else to seek your dinner.</p>
            <p>I do not mention this to you, as any thing that troubles me, do but take care of the Publick, and for what is necessary for the peace and quiet of the Kingdom, and take your own time for my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which I am sure you will provide for with as much affection and frankness as I can desire.</p>

               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF my presence here had not been requisite for the Passing these many Bills, I did always intend to see you together before your Adjournment, that I might again thank you for the many good things you have done for Me and the Kingdom; And in truth I do thank you more for what you have done for the Publick, then what you have done for my own particular, and yet I do thank you too for that with all my heart: But I confess to you, I do thank
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:197788:30"/>you more for the provision you have made to prevent Free-quarter, during the time the Army shall be disbanding, which I take to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for my satisfaction, then I do for the other Present you have made me for my own particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; and I do promise you, which is the best way I can take to gratifie you, I will not apply one peny of that money to my own particular occasions, what shift soever I make, till it is evident to me, that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick will not stand in need of it; and if it do, every peny of it shall be disbursed that way; and I dare say I shall not be the poorer for it.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of one particular Bill I have Passed, which may seem of an extraordinary nature, that concerning the Duke
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:197788:30"/>of <hi>Somerset,</hi> but you all know it is for an traordinary Person, who hath merited as much of the King My Father and My Self, as a Subject can do; and I am none of those, who think that Subjects by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their duties in an extraordinary manner, do not oblige their Princes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them in an extraordinary manner; there can be no danger from such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and I hope no man will envy him, because I have done what a good Master should do to such a Servant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I will not deny to you, that I had some Inclination, when I consented upon your desire to your Recess, to have made a Session, which I thought most agreeable to the ancient order of Parliaments, and I hope you will all joyn with Me in reducing the proceedings of Parliaments to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rules and Orders of Parliaments, the deviation from which hath done us
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:197788:31"/>no good, and I think there were never so many Bills passed together, as I have this day given My Assent to, without a Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: But upon the Desire and Reasons given by the House of Commons, for an Adjournment without a Session, I did very willingly depart from that Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do as willingly give you leave and direct you that you Adjourn your selves till the Sixth day of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> when I hope you will all meet again, and in the mean time that you will be all welcome to your Countreys, and do me much service there.</p>
            <p>I have many other particulars to say and recommend to you, in which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enough trust my own memory, and therefore I shall command the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to say the rest to you.</p>
            <p>(After His Majesty had ended His Speech, the Lord Chancellor said as followeth.)</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:197788:31"/>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe King tells you that He hath commanded me to say many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to you; and the truth is, He hath charged me with so many, that I have great reason to fear, that I shall stand in much need of His Mercy, for omitting many things He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me in command, at least for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them in more Disorder and Confusion, then matters of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Importance ought to be to such an Assembly, for which the King Himself hath even a kind of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as well as an extraordinary Kindnesse. I am to mention some things He hath done already, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things He intends to do during this Recess, that you may see, how well
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:197788:32"/>content soever He is, that you should have Ease, and Pleasure, and Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, He hath designed work enough for Himself.</p>
            <p>The King hath thanked you for the Provision you have made that there may be no free Quarter during the time the Army shall be Disbanding, and hath told you what He will do with that Money you have given Him, if there should want wherewithall to Disband it; And now I hope you will all believe, that His Majesty will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Disbanding: He will do so; And yet He does not take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly at their hands, who have thought that his Majesty would not Disband this Army; It was a sober and a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jealousie; No other Prince in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> would be willing to Disband such an Army; An Army to which Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:197788:32"/>is entailed, and which, humanely speaking, could hardly fail of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest whithersoever He should lead it; And if God had not restored His Majesty to that rare felicity, as to be without apprehension of danger at home or from abroad, and without any Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of taking from His Neighbours what they are possessed of, Himself would never Disband this Army; an Army, whose Order and Discipline, whose Sobriety and Manners, whose Courage and Success hath made it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and terrible over the world; An Army of which the King and his two Royal Brothers may say, as the noble <hi>Grecian</hi> said of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>They have all three in several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries found themselves engaged in the midst of these Troops, in the heat and rage of Battle; and if any common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier (as no doubt many may) will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the old <hi>Romans</hi> priviledge for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving encountred Princes single, upon my Conscience, he will find both Favour and Preferment: They have all three observed the Discipline, and felt, and admired, and loved the Courage of this Army, when they were the worse for it; and I have seen them in a season when there was little else of comfort in their view, refresh themselves with joy, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:197788:33"/>the <hi>English</hi> had done the great work, the <hi>English</hi> had got the day, and then please themselves with the Imagination what wonders they should perform in the head of such an Army: And therefore when His Majesty is so entirely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the affection and Obedience of this Army, and when it hath merited so much from Him, Can it be believed, or imagined, that He can without some regret part with them? No: My Lords and Gentlemen, He will never part with them; and the only sure way never to part with them, is to Disband them: Should it be otherwise, they must be exposed to the daily Importunity of His great Neighbours and Allies; and how could he refuse to lend them his Troops, of which He hath no use Himself? His Majesty knows they are too good <hi>English</hi> men, to wish
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:197788:34"/>that a standing Army should be kept up in the bowels of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; that they who did but <hi>in Bello pacis gerere negotium,</hi> and who, whilst an Army, lived like good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Countrey, and good Citizens in the City, will now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come really such, and take delight in the benefit of that Peace they have so honestly and so wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to pass: The King will part with them, as the most indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Parents part with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their education, and for their preferment; He will prefer them to Disbanding, and prefer them by Disbanding; and will alwaies retain such a kindness for them, and such a memory of the service they have done Him, that both Officers and Souldiers, after they are disbanded, shall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:197788:34"/>always finde such countenance, favor, and reward from His Majesty, that He doubts not, but if He should have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to use their Service, they will again resort to Him with the same alacrity, as if they had never been disbanded: And if there be any so ill amongst them (as there can be but very few, if any) who will forfeit that Favor and Protection they may have from Him, by any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing His Majesties commands, and the full and declared sense of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; His Majesty is confident they will be as odious to their companions, as they can be to any other honest men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I am in the next place, by the Kings command, to put you in minde of the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity, not of any Grants or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, or Releases He made to you in that Act; I have nothing of that in charge; no Prince hath so excellent a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:197788:35"/>memory to forget the Favors he doth; But of what He hath done against you in that Act, how you may be undone by that Act, if you are not very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perform the Obligations He hath laid upon you in it; the Clause I am to put you in minde of, is this, <hi>And to the intent and purpose that all names and terms of distinction may be likewise put into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Oblivion: Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or persons, within the space of Three years next ensuing, shall presume malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to call, or alledge, or object against any other person or persons any name or names, or other words of reproach, any way leading to revive the memory of the late differences, or the occasion thereof, That then every such person, so as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said offending, shall forfeit, &amp;c.</hi> It is no matter for the Penalty, it is too cheap a one; the King wishes it had been greater,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:197788:35"/>and therefore hath by His just Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (and 'tis well for us He hath such a Prerogative) added another Penalty more insupportable, even His high Displeasure against all who shall swerve from this Clause in the Act. Give me leave to tell you, That as any name or names, or other words of reproach, are expresly against the letter, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accordingly; so evil and envious looks, murmuring and discontented hearts, are as directly against the equity of this Statute, a direct breach of the Act of Indempnity, and ought to be punished too; and I believe they may be so. You know Kings are in some sense called Gods, and so they may in some degree be able to look into mens hearts; and God hath given us a King who can look as far into mens hearts as any Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; and He hath great skill in Physiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy too, you would wonder what
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:197788:36"/>Calculations He hath made from thence; and no doubt, if He be provoked by evil looks, to make a further enquiry into mens hearts, and findes those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the Passions of Envy and Uncharitableness, He will never chuse those hearts to trust and rely upon. He hath given us a Noble and Princely example, by opening and stretching His Arms to all who are worthy to be His Subjects, worthy to be thought English men, by extending His Heart with a pious and a grateful joy to finde all His Subjects at once in His Arms, and himself in theirs; and shall we fold our Arms towards one another, and contract our hearts with Envy and Malice to each other, by any sharp memory of what hath been unneighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or unkindly done heretofore? What is this but to rebel against the Person of the King, against the excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:197788:36"/>and Vertue of the King, against the known Law of the Land, this blessed Act of Oblivion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> The King is a Suitor to you, makes it His suit very heartily, That you will joyn with Him in restoring the whole Nation to its Primitive Temper and Integrity, to its old good manners, its old good humor, and its old good nature; Good nature, a vertue so peculiar to you, so appropriated by God Almighty to this Nation, that it can be translated into no other Language, hardly practised by any other people; and that you will by your example, by the candor of your Conversation, by your Precepts, and by your Practise, and by all your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, teach your Neighbors and your Friends, how to pay a full obedience to this clause of the Statute, how to learn this excellent art of Forgetfulness.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:197788:37"/>
            <p>Let them remember, and let us all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how ungracious, how indecent, how ugly, the insolence, the fierceness, the brutishness of their Enemies appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and we may piously and reasonably believe, that Gods indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against them, for their want of bowels, for their not being English men, (for they had the hearts of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi>) sent a Whirlwind in a moment to blow them out of the World, that is, out of a capacity to do more mischief in the World, except we practise their Vices, and do that our selves which we pretend to detest them for.</p>
            <p>Let us not be too much ashamed, as if what hath been done amiss, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the humor, and the temper, and the nature of our Nation. The <hi>Astrologers</hi> have made us a fair excuse, and truly I hope a true one; all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these last Twenty years have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:197788:37"/>been unnatural, and have proceeded from the evil influence of a malignant Star; and let us not too much despise the influence of the Stars: And the same <hi>Astrologers</hi> assure us, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of that Star is expired; the good <hi>genius</hi> of this Kingdom is become Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, and hath mastered that malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and our own good old Stars go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us again, and their influence is so strong, that with our help, they will repair in a year what hath been decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in twenty; and they onely shall have no excuse from the Star, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their malignity, and own all the ill that is past to be their own, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and improving it for the time to come.</p>
            <p>If any body here, or any where else, be too much exalted with what he hath done, or what he hath suffered, and from thence thinks himself warranted
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:197788:38"/>to reproach others, let him remember the story of <hi>Nicephorus;</hi> it is an excellent story, and very applicable to such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers: He was a pious and religious man, and for his Piety and Religion was condemned to the fire; when he was led to execution, and when an old Friend who had done him injury enough, fell at his feet and asked his pardon; the poor man was so elated with the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph he was going unto, with the glory of Martyrdom, that he refused to be reconciled unto him; upon which he was disappointed of his end; and for this uncharitableness, the Spirit of God immediately forsook him, and he apostatized from the Faith.</p>
            <p>Let all those who are too proud of having been as they think less faulty then other men, and so are unwilling to be reconciled to those who have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, take heed of the Apostacy
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:197788:38"/>of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> and that those fumes of Envy and Uncharitableness, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, do not so far transport and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate them, that they fall into those very Crimes, they value themselves for having hitherto declined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But my Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> whilest we conspire together, to execute faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully this part of the Bill, to put all old names and terms of distinction into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Oblivion; let us not finde new names and terms to keep up the same, or a worse distinction: If the old reproaches of Cavalier, and Round-Head, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, be committed to the Grave; let us not finde more significant and better words, to signifie worse things; let not Piety and Godliness grow into terms of reproach, and distinguish between the Court and the City and the Country; and let not Piety and Godliness be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surred by a morofity in Manners; an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:197788:39"/>of Gesture, a new mode and tone of Speaking; at least, let not our Constitutions and Complexions make us be thought of a contrary Party; and because we have not an affected austerity in our looks, that we have not Piety in our hearts. Very merry men have been very godly men; and if a good <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> be a continual <hi>Feast,</hi> there is no reason but men may be very merry at it.</p>
            <p>You, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> have this day made a Noble Present to the King. Do you think that if you and your worthy Companions had brought it up with folded Arms, down-cast Looks, with Sighs and other Instances of Desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would not have been a very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Present? Have not your frank and dutiful Expressions, that chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and vivacity in your Looks, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it much more acceptable, much
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:197788:39"/>more valuable? No Prince in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom loves a chearful giver, so well as <hi>God Almighty</hi> does; and he of all gifts, a chearful heart: And therefore I pray let not a cloudy and disconsolate face, be the onely or the best sign of Piety and Devotion in the heart.</p>
            <p>I must ask your pardon for mispla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing much of this Discourse, which I should have mentioned, when I came to speak of the Ministers Bill; they I hope will endeavor to remove these new marks of Distinction and Reproaches, and keep their Auditories from being imposed upon by such Characters and Descriptions. The King hath passed this Act very willingly, and done much to the end of this Act before; yet hath willingly admitted you to be sharers and partners with Him in the Obligation: I may say confidently, His Majesty hath never denied His
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:197788:40"/>Confirmation to any man in possession who hath asked it; and they have all had the effect of it, except such who upon examination and enquiry, appeared not worthy of it, and such who though they are pardoned, cannot yet think themselves worthy to be prefer'd. His Majesty well knows, that by this Act He hath gratified and obliged many worthy and pious men, who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to His Restauration, and who shall always receive fresh evidence of His Majesties favor and kindness; but He is not sure that He may not likewise have gratified some who did neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to His coming in, nor are yet glad that He is in; how comes it else to pass, that He receives such frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Seditious Sermons in the City, and in the Countrey; in which, all industry is used to alienate the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, and to infuse Jealousies
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:197788:40"/>into them of the King and His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: They talk of introducing Popery, of evil Counsellors, and such other old Calumnies as are pardoned by this Act of Indempnity.</p>
            <p>His Majesty told you when He was last here, what rigor and severity He will hereafter use, how contrary soever it is to His Nature, in these cases; and conjured you, <hi>My Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> to concur with Him in this just and necessary Severity, which I am sure you will do with your utmost vigilance, and that you will believe that too much ill cannot befal those who do the best they can to corrupt His Majesties Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to extinguish His Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I told you I was to acquaint you with some things His Majesty intends to do during this Recess, that you may see He will give no intermission to His own Thoughts for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:197788:41"/>the Publick good, though for a time He dispences with your Assistance.</p>
            <p>He doth consider the infinite import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the Improvement of Trade must be to this Kingdom, and therefore His Majesty intends forthwith to establish a Council for Trade, consisting of some Principal Merchants of the several Companies; to which He will adde some Gentlemen of Quality and Experience; and for their greater honor and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, some of my Lords of His own Privy Council.</p>
            <p>In the next place, His Majesty hopes that by a well-setled Peace, and Gods great blessing upon Him and you, this Nation will in a short time flourish to that degree, that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, when <hi>Esau</hi> found it necessary to part from his Brother. — For their riches were more, than that they might dwell together, and the Land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:197788:41"/>they were, could not bear them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Cattle. We have been our selves very near this Pinacle of Happiness, and the hope and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation that we may be so again, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the King to be very solicitous for the Improvement and Prosperity of His Plantations abroad, where there is such large room for the Industry and Reception of such who shall desire to go thither: And therefore His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty likewise intends to erect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish a Council for those Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which, Persons well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied shall be wholly intent upon the good and advancement of those Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>There are two other Particulars, which I am commanded to mention, which were both mentioned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to you by His Majesty in His Declaration from <hi>Breda:</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:197788:42"/>The one, for the Confirmation of Sales, or other recompence for Purchasers: The other, for the composing those Differences and Distempers in Religion, which have too much disturbed the Peace of the Kingdom. Two very weighty particulars, in which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty knows you have spent much time, and concerning which, He should have heard from you before this time, if you had not met with great Difficulties in the Disquisition of either.</p>
            <p>For the first, His Majesty hath not been without much thought upon the Argument, and hath done much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the accommodation of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons; and you shall not be at your journeys end, before His Majesty will put that business concerning Sales into such a way of Dispatch, that He doubts not you will finde a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress made in it before your coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:197788:42"/>again, and I believe the Persons concerned, will be very much too blame, if they receive not good satisfaction: And some of you who stay in Town, shall be advised and consulted with in that settlement.</p>
            <p>The other, of Religion, is a sad Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument indeed; It is a Consideration that must make every Religious Heart to bleed, to see Religion which should be the strongest Obligation and Ciment of Affection, and Brotherly Kindness and Compassion, made now by the perverse Wranglings of passionate and froward Men, the ground of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity, Hatred, Malice and Revenge. And this unruly and unmanly Passion (which no question the Divine Nature exceedingly abhors) sometimes, and I fear too frequently transports those who are in the right, as well as those who are in the wrong, and leaves the latter more
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:197788:43"/>excusable then the former, when men who finde their Manners and Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very conformable in all the necessary Obligations of Humane Nature, avoid one anothers Conversation, and grow first unsociable, and then uncharitable to each other, because one cannot think as the other doth. And from this sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we intitle God to the Patronage of, and Concernment in our Fancies and Distinction, and purely for his sake hate one another heartily. It was not so of old, when one of the most ancient Fathers of the Church tells us, That Love and Charity was so signal and eminent in the Primitive Christians, that it even drew Admiration and Envy from their Adversaries. <hi>Vide (inquiunt) ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicem se diligunt!</hi> Their Adversaries in that in which they most agreed, in their very prosecution of them, had their Passions and Animosities amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:197788:43"/>they were onely Christians, that loved, and cherished, and comforted, and were ready to die for one another; <hi>Quid nunc illi dicerent Christiani, si nostra viderent tempora?</hi> Says the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Grotius:</hi> How would they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our sharp and virulent Contentions in the debates of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and the Bloody Wars that have proceeded from those Contentions, whilest every one pretended to all the Marks which are to attend upon the true Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely that which is inseparable from it, <hi>Charity to one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition hath cost the King many a sigh, many a sad hour, when he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the almost irreparable reproach the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> hath undergone, from the Divisions and Distractions which have been so notorious within this Kingdom.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:197788:44"/>
            <p>What pains he hath taken to compose them, after several Discourses with Learned and Pious Men of Different Perswasions, you will shortly see by a Declaration He will publish upon that occasion; by which you will see His great indulgence to those who can have any Protection from <hi>Conscience,</hi> to differ with their Brethren. And I hope God will so bless the Candor of His Majesty in the Condescentions He makes, That the Church as well as the State, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that Unity and Unanimity, which will make both King and People as happy as they can hope to be in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I shall conclude with the Kings hearty Thanks to you, not onely for what you have done towards Him, which hath been very Signal, but for what you have done towards each other; for the excellent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:197788:44"/>Correspondence you have maintained; for the very Seasonable Deference and Condescention you have had for each other, which will restore <hi>Parliaments</hi> to the Veneration they ought to have. And since His Majesty knows, that you all desire to please Him, you have given Him ample evidence, that you do so; He hath appointed me to give you a sure Receipt to attain that good end, it is a Receipt of His own prescribing, and therefore is not like to fail:</p>
            <p>Be but pleased your selves, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade others to be so; contrive all the ways imaginable for your own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and you will make Him the best pleased, and the most happy Prince in the World.</p>

            <head>HIS MAJESTIES DECLARATION TO ALL His Loving Subjects of His Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> Concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs.</head>
            <opener>
               <signed>CHARLES R.</signed>
            </opener>
            <p>HOw much the Peace of the State is concerned in the Peace of the Church, and how difficult a thing it is to preserve Order and Government in Civil, whilest there is no Order or Government in Ecclesiastical Affairs, is evident to the World; and this little part of the World, Our own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath had so late experience of it,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:197788:45"/>that We may very well acquiesce in the Conclusion, without enlarging Our Self in discourse upon it, it being a subject We have had frequent occasion to contemplate upon, and to lament, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad as well as at home.</p>
            <p>In Our Letter to the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the House of Commons from <hi>Breda,</hi> We declared how much We desired the Advancement and Propagation of the Protestant Religion: That neither the unkindness of those of the same Faith towards Us, nor the Civilities and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations from those of a contrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (of both which We have had abundant evidence) could in the least degree startle Us, or make Us swerve from it, and that nothing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to manifest Our Zeal and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, to which We will not readily consent: And We said then, That We did hope in due time, Our Self to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:197788:46"/>somewhat for the Propagation of it, that will satisfie the World, that We have always made it both Our Care and Our Study, and have enough observed what is most like to bring disadvantage to it. And the truth is, We do think Our Self the more competent to propose, and with Gods assistance to determine many things now in difference, from the time We have spent, and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence We have had in most of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad, in <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> where We have had frequent Conferences, with the most Learned men, who have unanimously lamented the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Protestant Religion under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes from the Distempers and too No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Schisms in Matters of Religion in <hi>England:</hi> And as the most Learned amongst them have always with great Submission and Reverence acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:197788:46"/>and magnified the established Government of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the great countenance and shelter the Protestant Religion received from it, before these unhappy times: So many of them have with great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and Sorrow confessed, that they were too easily misled by mis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and prejudice into some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem of it, as if it had too much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereas they now acknowledge it to be the best Fence God hath yet raised against Popery in the World: And We are perswaded, they do with great Zeal wish it restored to its old Dignity and Veneration.</p>
            <p>When We were in <hi>Holland,</hi> We were attended by many grave and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ministers from hence, who were looked upon as the most able and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Assertors of the Presbyterian opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:197788:47"/>with whom VVe had as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as the multitude of Affairs which were then upon Us would permit Us to have; and to Our great Satisfaction and Comfort found them Persons full of Affection to Us, of Zeal for the Peace of the Church and State, and neither Enemies (as they have been given out to be) to Episcopacy, or Liturgy, but modestly to desire such alterations in either, as without shaking Foundations, might best allay the present distempers, which the Indisposition of the time, and the tenderness of some mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences had contracted: For the better doing whereof, We did intend upon Our first arrival in this Kingdom to call a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of Divines, as the most proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to provide a proper remedy for all those differences and dis-satisfactions which had or should arise in matters of Religion; and in the mean time, We
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:197788:47"/>published in Our Declaration from <hi>Breda</hi> a Liberty to tender Consciences; and that no man should be disquieted or called in question for differences of opinion in matter of Religion, which do not disturb the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that We shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Parliament as upon mature deliberation shall be offered to Us, for the full granting that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</p>
            <p>Whilest We continued in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Minde and Resolution, and have so far complied with the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of particular Persons, and the distemper of the time, as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the exercise of Our Religion in Our own Chappel, according to the constant practice and Laws established, without enjoyning that practice, and the observation of those Laws, in the Churches of the Kingdom; in which We
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:197788:48"/>have undergone the Censure of many, as if We were without that Zeal for the Church, which We ought to have, and which by Gods Grace, We shall always retain: We have found Our Self not so candidly dealt with as We have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and that there are unquiet and restless Spirits, who without abating any of their own distemper, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Moderation they finde in Us, continue their bitterness against the Church, and endeavor to raise Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies of Us, and to lessen Our Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by their Reproaches, as if We were not true to the Professions We have made: And in order thereunto, they have very unseasonably caused to be Printed, published, and dispersed throughout the Kingdom a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heretofore Printed in Our Name, during the time of Our being in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of which We shall say no more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:197788:48"/>than that the Circumstances by which We were enforced to sign that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are enough known to the World; And that the worthiest and greatest part of that Nation did even then detest and abhor the ill usage of Us in that particular, when the same Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny was exercised there by the power of a few ill men, which at that time had spread it self over this Kingdom; and therefore We had no reason to expect that We should at this season, when We are doing all We can to wipe out the memory of all that hath been done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss by other men, and, We thank God, have wiped it out of Our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, have been Our Self assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with those Reproaches, which We will likewise forget.</p>
            <p>Since the Printing this Declaration, several seditious Pamphlets and Quaeres have been published and scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:197788:49"/>to infuse dislike and Jealousies into the hearts of the People, and of the Army, and some who ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have repented the former mischief they have wrought, than to have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to improve it, have had the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to publish, that the Doctrine of the Church, against which no man with whom We have conferred hath except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought to be reformed as well as the Discipline.</p>
            <p>This over-passionate and turbulent way of proceeding, and the Impatience We finde in many for some speedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in these matters, whereby the mindes of men may be composed, and the Peace of the Church established, hath prevailed with Us to invert the method We had proposed to Our Self, and even in order to the better calling and composing of a Synod (which the present Jealousies will hardly agree
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:197788:49"/>upon) by the assistance of Gods blessed Spirit, which We daily invoke and supplicate to give some determination Our Self to the matters in difference, until such a Synod may be called, as may without passion or prejudice, give Us such farther assistance towards a perfect Union of Affections, as well as submission to Authority, as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: And We are the rather induced to take this upon Us, by finding upon the full Conference We have had with the learned men of several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, that the mischiefs, under which both the Church and State do at present suffer, do not result from any formed Doctrine or Conclusion which either Party maintains or avows, but from the Passion and Appetite and Interest of particular Persons, who contract greater prejudice to each other, from those Affections, than would
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:197788:50"/>naturally rise from their Opinions; and those distempers must be in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree allayed, before the meeting in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod can be attended with better success, than their meeting in other places, and their discourses in Pulpits have hitherto been; and till all thoughts of Victory are laid aside, the humble and necessary thoughts for the Vindication of Truth cannot be enough entertained.</p>
            <p>We must for the honor of all those of either perswasion with whom We have conferred, declare, That the Professions and Desires of all for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Piety and true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are the same; their Professions of Zeal for the Peace of the Church, the same; of Affection and Duty to Us, the same: They all approve Episcopacy; they all approve a set Form of Liturgy; and they all disapprove and dislike the Sin of Sacriledge, and the Alienation
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:197788:50"/>of the Revenue of the Church; And if upon these excellent Foundations, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to which there is such a harmony of Affections, any Superstructures should be raised, to the shaking those Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to the contracting and lessening the blessed gift of Charity, which is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part of Christian Religion, We shall think Our Self very unfortunate, and even suspect that We are defective in that administration of Government with which God hath entrusted Us.</p>
            <p>We need not profess the high Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and esteem We have for the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it is established by Law; the Reverence to which hath supported us, with Gods blessing, against many temptations; nor do We think that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in the least degree diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Our Condescentions, not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily to insist on some particulars of Ceremony, which, however intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:197788:51"/>by the Piety and Devotion, and Order of former times, may not be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the present, but may even les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen that Piety and Devotion, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement whereof they might happily be first introduced, and consequently may well be dispensed with; and We hope this charitable compliance of Ours will dispose the minds of all men to a cheerful submisson to that Authority, the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation whereof is so necessary for the Unity and Peace of the Church; and that they will acknowledge the support of the Episcopal Authority, to be the best sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Religion, by being the best means to contein the minds of men within the Rules of Government: And they who would restrain the exercise of that holy function within the Rules which were observed in the Primitive times, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and consider, that the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Power being in those blessed times
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:197788:51"/>alwaies subordinate and subject to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, it was likewise proportioned to such an extent of Jurisdiction as was most agreeable to that: And as the Sanctity and Simplicity, and Resignation of that Age, did then refer many things to the Bishops, which the policy of succeeding Ages would not admit, at least did otherwise provide for; so it can be no reproach to primitive Episcopacy, if where there have been great alterations in the Civil Government, from what was then, there have been likewise some difference and alteration in the Ecclesiastical, the Essence and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation being still preserved. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, without taking upon Us to censure the Government of the Church in other Countreys, where the Government of the State is different from what it is here, or enlarging Our Self upon the Reasons
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:197788:52"/>why, whilest there was an Imagination of erecting a Democratical Government here in the State, they should be willing to continue an Aristocratical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church; It shall suffice to say, that since by the wonderful blessing of God, the hearts of this whole Nation are returned to an obedience to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chique Government in the State, it must be very reasonable to support that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church which is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law, and with which the Monarchy hath flourished through so many Ages, and which is in truth as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in this Island as the Christian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy thereof; and which hath alwaies in some respects or degrees been enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or restrained, as hath been thought most conducing to the Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Kingdome; and therefore VVe have not the least doubt but that the present Bishops will think the present
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:197788:52"/>Concessions now made by Us to allay the present distempers, very just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and will very cheerfully conform themselves thereunto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. VVe do in the first place Declare, Our purpose and Resolution is and shall be to promote the power of Godliness, to encourage the exercises of Religion both publique and private, and to take care that the Lords day be applied to holy exercises, without unnecessary divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that insufficient, negligent, and scandalous Ministers be not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Church: And that as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Bishops are known to be men of great and exemplar Piety in their lives, which they have manifested in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and unexampled Sufferings du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these late distempers; and of great and known sufficiency of learning; So We shall take special Care, by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of God, to prefer no men to that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:197788:53"/>Office and Charge, but men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Virtue, and Piety, who may be themselves the best examples to those who are to be Governed by them; And We shall expect, and provide the best We can, that the Bishops be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Preachers, and that they do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often Preach themselves in some Church of their Diocess, except they be hindred by sickness, or other bodily infirmities, or some other justifiable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, which shall not be thought justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable if it be frequent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because the Diocesses, especially some of them, are thought to be of too large extent; VVe will appoint such a Number of Suffragan Bishops in every Diocess as shall be sufficient for the due performance of their work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No Bishop shall Ordain, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise any part of Jurisdiction which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the Censures of the Church,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:197788:53"/>without the advice and assistance of the Presbyters; And no Chancellors, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries, or Officials, as such, shall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise any Act of Spiritual Jurisdiction in these cases <hi>(viz.)</hi> Excommunication, Absolution, or wherein any of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry are concerned, with reference to their Pastoral Charge. However our intent and meaning is to uphold and maintain the Profession of the Civil Law, so far and in such matters as it hath been of use and practise within Our Kingdoms and Dominions; Albeit as to Excommunication, Our VVill and Pleasure is, that no Chancellor, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary, or Official shall Decree any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication or Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or be Judges in those things wherein any of the Ministry are concerned, as is aforesaid. Nor shall the Arch-Deacon exercise any Jurisdiction without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and assistance of six Ministers of his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:197788:54"/>Arch-Deaconry, whereof three to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the Bishop, and three by the election of the major part of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within the Arch-Deaconry.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To the end that the Deans and Chapters may be the better fitted to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Councel and Assistance to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, both in Ordination and the other Offices mentioned before; We will take care that those Preferments be given to the most learned and Pious Presbyters of the Diocess; And moreover, that an equal number (to those of the Chapter) of the most learned, pious, and discreet Presbyters of the same Diocess, annually chosen by the major vote of all the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that Diocess present at such Elections, shall be alwaies advising and assisting, together with those of the Chapter, in all Ordinations, and in every part of Jurisdiction which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Censures of the Church,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:197788:54"/>and at all other solemn and important acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the exercise of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction wherein any of the Ministery are concerned: Provided, that at all such meetings, the number of the Ministers so elected, and those present of the Chapter shall be equal, and not exceed one the other, and that to make the numbers equal, the Juniors of the exceeding number be withdrawn, that the most ancient may take place: Nor shall any Suffragan Bishop Ordain or exercise the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Offices and Acts of Spiritual Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but with the advice and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a sufficient number of the most judicious and pious Presbyters, annually chosen, as aforesaid, within his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts: And Our Will is, that the great Work of Ordination be constantly and solemnly performed by the Bishop and his aforesaid Presbytery, at the four set times and seasons appointed by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:197788:55"/>the Church for that purpose.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We will take care that Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be rightly and solemnly performed, by the Information, and with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Minister of the place; who shall admit none to the Lord's Supper, till they have made a credible Profession of their Faith, and promised Obedience to the Will of God, according as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Considerations of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick before the Catechism; And that all possible diligence be used for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Reformation of scandalous Offenders, whom the Minister shall not suffer to partake of the Lord's Table, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they have openly declared themselves to have truly repented, and amended their former naughty lives, as is partly expressed in the Rubrick, and more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Canons; Provided there be place for due Appeals to Superior Powers. But besides the Suffragans and their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:197788:55"/>every Rural Dean (those Deans, as heretofore, to be nominated by the Bishop of the Diocess) together with three or four Ministers of that Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, chosen by the major part of all the Ministers within the same, shall meet once in every moneth, to receive such complaints as shall be presented to them by the Ministers or Church-Wardens of the respective Parishes; and also to compose all such differences betwixt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and party, as shall be referred unto them by way of Arbitration, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Offenders, and reform all such things as they finde amiss, by their Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reproofs and Admonitions, if they may be so reformed: And such matters as they cannot by this Pastoral and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive way compose and reform, are by them to be prepared for, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Bishop; at which meeting any other Ministers of that Deanery, may,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:197788:56"/>if they please, be present and assist. Moreover, the Rural Dean and his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants are in their respective Divisions, to see that the children and yonger sort be carefully instructed by the respective Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of every Parish, in the Grounds of Christian Religion, and be able to give a good acount of their Faith and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and also of their Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation conformable thereunto, before they be confirmed by the Bishop, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p n="6">6. No Bishop shall exercise any Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power, or do or impose any thing upon the Clergy or the People, but what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the known Law of the Land.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We are very glad to finde, that all with whom We have conferred, do in their Judgements approve a Liturgy, or set Form of Publick Worship, to be lawful; which in Our Judgement, for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:197788:56"/>the preservation of Unity, and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, We conceive to be very necessary: And though We do esteem the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> contained in the Book of Common Prayer, and by Law established, to be the best We have seen; and We believe that We have seen all that are extant and used in this part of the World, and well know what Reverence most of the Reformed Churches, or at least the most Learned men in those Churches have for it; Yet since We finde some exceptions made against several things therein, We will appoint an equal number of Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of both Perswasions, to re-view the same, and to make such alterations as shall be thought most necessary; and some additional Forms (in the Scripture phrase, as near as may be) suited unto the nature of the several parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and that it be left to the Ministers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:197788:57"/>choice to use one or other at his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the mean time, and till this be done, although We do heartily wish and desire, that the Ministers in their several Churches, because they dislike some Clauses and Expressions, would not totally lay aside the use of the Book of Common Prayer, but read those parts against which there can be no exception; which would be the best instance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining those marks of distinction, which We so much labour and desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; yet in compassion to divers of Our good Subjects, who scruple the use of it as now it is, Our Will and Pleasure is, that none be punished or troubled for not using it, until it be reviewed, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually Reformed, as aforesaid.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Lastly, Concerning Ceremonies, which have administred so much matter of difference and contention, and which have been introduced by the Wisdom
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:197788:57"/>and Authority of the Church, for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the improvement of Piety: We shall say no more, but that We have the more esteem of all, and Reverence for many of them, by having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in many of those Churches where they are most abolished, or discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; And it cannot be doubted, but that, as the Universal Church cannot intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one Ceremony in the Worship of God, that is contrary to Gods Word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Scripture; so every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, with the Approbation and Consent of the Soveraign Power, may, and hath always introduced such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ceremonies, as in that conjuncture of time are thought most proper for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the necessary improvement of Piety and Devotion in the People, though the necessary practice thereof cannot be deduced from Scripture; And that which before was, and in it self is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:197788:58"/>ceases to be indifferent, after it is once established by Law: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Our present Consideration and Work is, to gratifie the private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of those who are grieved with the use of some Ceremonies, by indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and dispencing with their omitting those Ceremonies; not utterly to abolish any which are Established by Law, (if any are practised contrary to Law, the same shall cease) which would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, and of ill example; and to impose upon the Conscience of some, for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Conscience of others, which is otherwise provided for. As it could not be reasonable that men should expect that We should Our Self decline, or enjoyn others to do so, to receive the Blessed Sacrament upon Our Knees, which in Our Conscience is the most humble, most devout, and most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able posture for that holy Duty, because
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:197788:58"/>some other men, upon reasons best, if not only known to themselves, choose rather to do it sitting or standing: We shall leave all decisions and determinations of that kinde, if they shall be thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for a perfect and entire Unity and Uniformity throughout the Nation, to the advice of a National Synod, which shall be duly called, after a little time, and a mutual Conversation between persons of different perswasions, hath mollified those distempers, abated those sharpnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and extinguished those jealousies which make men unfit for those Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; And upon such Advice, We shall use Our best endeavour that such Laws may be established, as may best provide for the Peace of the Church and State. Provided that none shall be denied the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, though they do not use the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of kneeling in the act of receiving.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:197788:59"/>
            <p>In the mean time, out of Compassion and Compliance towards those who would for bear the Cross in Baptism, We are content that no man shall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to use the same, or suffer for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: But if any Parent desire to have his Childe Christened according to the Form used, and the Minister will not use the Sign, it shall be lawful for that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to procure another Minister to do it: And if the proper Minister shall refuse to omit that Ceremony of the Cross, it shall be lawful for the Parent, who would not have his Childe so Baptized, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure another Minister to do it, who will do it according to his desire.</p>
            <p>No man shall be compelled to bow at the Name of JESUS, or suffer in any degree for not doing it, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching those who out of their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continue that ancient Ceremony of the Church.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:197788:59"/>
            <p>For the use of the Surplice, We are contented that all men be left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do as they shall think fit, without suffering in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for wearing or not wearing it; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that this liberty do not extend to Our own Chappel, Cathedral, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Churches, or to any Colledge in either of Our Universities; but that the several Statutes and Customs for the use thereof in the said places, be there obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as formerly.</p>
            <p>And because some men, otherwise pious and learned, say they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto the Subscription required by the Canon, nor take the Oath of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Obedience; We are content, and it is Our Will and Pleasure, (so they take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy) that they shall receive Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Institution, and Induction, and shall be permitted to exercise their Function,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:197788:60"/>and to enjoy the Profits of their Livings, without the said Subscription or Oath of Canonical Obedience: And moreover, That no persons in the Universities shall for the want of such Subscription, be hindred in the taking of their Degrees. Lastly, That none be judged to forfeit his Presentation or Benefice, or be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it, upon the Statute of the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Chapter the Twelfth, so he read and declare his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to all the Articles of Religion, which only concern the Confession of the true Christian Faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments, comprised in the Book of Articles, in the said Statute mentioned. In a word, We do again renew what We have formerly said in Our Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Breda,</hi> for the liberty of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consciences, that no man shall be disquieted or called in question for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Opinion in matters of Religion,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:197788:60"/>which do not disturb the Peace of the Kingdom; and if any have been disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that kinde since Our arrival here, it hath not proceeded from any Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ours.</p>
            <p>To conclude, and in this place to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what We mentioned before, and said in Our Letter to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from <hi>Breda,</hi> That We hoped in due time, Our Self to propose somewhat for the Propagation of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that will satisfie the World, that We have always made it both Our Care and Our Study, and have enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served what is most like to bring disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to it: We do conjure all Our Loving Subjects to acquiesce in, and submit to this Our Declaration concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those differences which have so much disquieted the Nation at home, and given such offence to the Protestant Churches abroad, and brought such reproach
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:197788:61"/>upon the Protestant Religion in general, from the enemies thereof; as if upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure notions of Faith and Fancy, it did admit the practice of Christian Duties and Obedience to be discountenanced and suspended, and introduce a Licence in Opinions and Manners, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Christian Faith. And let Us all endeavour, and emulate each other in those endeavours, to countenance and advance the Protestant Religion abroad, which will be best done by supporting the Dignity and Reverence due to the best Reformed Protestant Church at home; and which being once freed from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and Reproaches it hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone from these late ill times, will be the best shelter for those abroad, which will, by that Countenance, both be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter protected against their enemies, and be the more easily induced to compose the differences amongst themselves,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:197788:61"/>which give their enemies more advantage against them: And We hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that all men will henceforward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to vent any such Doctrine in the Pulpit, or to endeavour to work in such manner upon the Affections of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as may dispose them to an ill opinion of Us and the Government, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the Peace of the Kingdom. Which if all men will in their several Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons endeavour to preserve with the same Affection and Zeal We Our Self will do; all Our good Subjects will, by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon Us, enjoy as great a measure of Felicity, as this Nation hath ever done, and which We shall constantly labour to procure for them, as the greatest blessing God can bestow upon Us in this World.</p>
